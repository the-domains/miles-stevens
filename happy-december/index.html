It was a pretty low-key month, and we mainly focused on getting things together for our annual Advent devotional. Every year, Rick (our lead pastor) puts together five devotionals—one for each Sunday leading up to Christmas. This year, he decided to do one for each day! Much of our time was spent creating header images, copy editing, and a bit of writing here and there.</p><p>Before coming to Fellowship, Advent was never something I gave much thought to—I knew about it but never really understood the significance and it was never something I intentionally celebrated. Last year, Brandin and I started following the devotionals Rick put out each week and decided to get our own Advent candles to light each Sunday. For those who aren't particularly familiar (as I wasn't until about a year ago), Advent means "coming" or "arrival" and celebrates the first coming of Christ through his birth while also exhorting us to anticipate his second coming. Because we live in expectation of Christ's final arrival, part of Advent is also a recognition of sin and our need for the grace Christ extends to us. As a result, scripture that accompanies the season of Advent are often a mix between ones meant to engage us in celebration, and also ones meant to engage us in prayer, repentance, and sometimes fasting. Something important to remember about Advent and Christmas is that they are man-made holidays; there is no single "way" of celebrating them, provided our focus is on celebrating the coming of Jesus while maintaining a posture of humility and thankfulness.</p><h2>Projects</h2><picture>

<p>The devotional turned out really great and we're releasing one week at a time. I would encourage all of you to engage in scripture this month, even if its just a few verses, to engage your heart with Christ and all that he promises though his advent. You can follow the devotional by clicking the button below to get you going!</p><p><a href="https://slate.adobe.com/slate-web/editor.html?theme=Crisp">Advent Devotional</a></p><picture>

<p>Jackson Terminal was, until recently, an abandoned train station in the Old City district of downtown Knoxville. This past year it was bought and renovated as a space available to rent for parties, weddings, gatherings, etc. and it has a lot of character to it. I was exited to hear we're hosting a Christmas party for our young adults there and was super inspired by the urban/rustic feel of the environment.</p><picture>

<p>Of course, thank you to all who have been—and still are—praying for Brandin throughout the past few weeks. She underwent a bit of surgery (planned) and has been struggling through recovery. She's a trooper and has done her best to remain helpful and hard-working around the house and at United Way despite her being mostly confined to the bed and couch. This surgery was a blessing and should dispel much of the pain and discomfort she has to wade through on a daily basis, if only for a few years.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Happy December!</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>

Because we live in expectation of Christ's final arrival, part of Advent is also a recognition of sin and our need for the grace Christ extends to us. As a result, scripture that accompanies the season of Advent are often a mix between ones meant to engage us in celebration, and also ones meant to engage us in prayer, repentance, and sometimes fasting. Something important to remember about Advent and Christmas is that they are man-made holidays; there is no single \"way\" of celebrating them, provided our focus is on celebrating the coming of Jesus while maintaining a posture of humility and thankfulness."},{"id":"f8971fc6-33e7-4160-99a1-859895e3f0a7","item":"a3922dbc-b301-47d0-9836-6855f32ce2e5","type":"h2","html":"<h2>Projects</h2>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"Projects"},{"id":"7fed421a-a36a-47b8-b529-ca664622672a","item":"a3922dbc-b301-47d0-9836-6855f32ce2e5","type":"image","html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bcdc7a07ca3a5452f7501fa6d4c7523e/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=1440\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d8512fe5344e7bae15524b4042c34245/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=1280\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2bcb01533bb4080c74bddfbdab032ab4/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f90dff955f11e299a15abe669ca68c60/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bcdc7a07ca3a5452f7501fa6d4c7523e/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=1440\">\n</picture>\n","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"starred":false},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bcdc7a07ca3a5452f7501fa6d4c7523e/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=1440","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/746bff28-824a-417a-a196-421601816bb6.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bcdc7a07ca3a5452f7501fa6d4c7523e/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=1440"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d8512fe5344e7bae15524b4042c34245/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=1280"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2bcb01533bb4080c74bddfbdab032ab4/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f90dff955f11e299a15abe669ca68c60/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6770d94437a3b725a5b3d0b96244bea64469187b.jpg&width=360"}],"ratio":"64:33","aspect":1.9393939393939394,"orientation":"landscape","width":2048,"height":1056,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"colors":[[13,13,15],[255,255,255],[54,97,150],[96,139,190],[139,181,223]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[238,2],[1810,922]],"confidence":0.182741,"center":[1022,488],"radius":857.07},"exif":{"image":{"Orientation":1,"ExifOffset":38},"thumbnail":{},"exif":{"ColorSpace":1,"ExifImageWidth":2048,"ExifImageHeight":1152},"gps":{},"interoperability":{},"makernote":{}}}},{"id":"38b5bdcb-f520-480b-9511-12be901eab73","item":"a3922dbc-b301-47d0-9836-6855f32ce2e5","type":"text","html":"<p>The devotional turned out really great and we're releasing one week at a time.
